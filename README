How to write config file
===============================

conf.yaml file should be 'utf-8'.

input
--------

Google Reader Starred
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You should make "public" your starred.

|  googlereader:
|    url: http://www.google.com/reader/public/atom/user/XXXXX/state/com.google/starred

Twitter 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|  twitter:
|    url: http://twitter.com/statuses/user_timeline/XXXXX.rss
|    keyword: "メモ"

"keyword" means if this keyword is in your tweet, output it. if "keyword" is not in conf.yaml, all of your tweet will be outputed.

Twitter Favorites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|  twitterfav:
|    url: http://twitter.com/favorites/XXXXX.rss


output
--------

Instapaper
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|  instapaper:
|    username: XXXX@example.com
|    password: xxXpasswordXxx

mail
~~~~~~~
    
|  mail:
|    mail_addr: XXXX@example.com
|    from_addr: infodrawer@example.com # if use gmail, replaced to the addr
|    smtp: localhost 
|    use_gmail: no # if yes, smtp will be ignored
|    gmail_addr: XXXX@gmail.com
|    gmail_pass: xxXgmailpassXxx

Mail address can manage multiple addresses like this.

|    mail_addr: XXXX@example.com, XXXX-2@example.com

If you want to use gmail instead of your SMTP server, change use_gmail
to "yes" and write down address and password. If use_gmail is "yes", smtp will be ignored and from_addr is replaced to gmail_addr by gmail.com.

Evernote
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|  evernote:
|    mail_addr: XXXX@m.evernote.com
|    from_addr: infodrawer@example.com # if use gmail, replaced to the addr
|    note: "あとで"
|    tag: "infodrawer"
|    smtp: localhost 
|    use_gmail: yes # if yes, smtp will be ignored
|    gmail_addr: XXXX@gmail.com
|    gmail_pass: xxXgmailpassXxx

almost same as mail output.

Currently, "note" and "tag" should be only one.
